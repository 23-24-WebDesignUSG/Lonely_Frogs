    	<h3>What is Internet Privacy?</h3>
    	<p>The standard definition of privacy incorporates two important elements: "<strong>the state of being alone</strong> and <strong>not being watched or interrupted by other people.</strong>‚Äù<br>

The definition of <strong>online privacy </strong>covers your natural (and justified) expectation to have your personal data protected and your behavior not tracked when you are connected to the Internet.  At least not without your explicit consent.</p>

<div class="Intro">
<p style="font-size: 25;font-family: Tahoma;color: royalblue;"><strong><u>Internet privacy has become a major concern in today's digital age.  With the increasing amount of personal data being collected and stored online, users are often unaware of the risks and implications.</u></strong></p>

  <h3> What can we do?</h3>
  <p style="background-color: #cfe2e8;border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #cfe2e8">To protect our online privacy, we can take several proactive measures:<br><br>

1.   Use Strong Passwords: Create unique and complex passwords for each of your online accounts.   Avoid using easily guessable information like your name, birthdate, or common words.<br><br>

2.   Update Privacy Settings: Regularly review and adjust the privacy settings on your social media accounts, email services, and other online platforms to control who can see your information.<br><br>

3.  Limit Sharing Personal Information: Be cautious about sharing personal information online, especially on public forums and social media.   Avoid posting sensitive information like your address, phone number, and financial details.<br><br>

4.  Secure Your Devices: Keep your devices, including computers, smartphones, and tablets, up to date with the latest security patches and antivirus software.   Use encryption features to secure sensitive data stored on your devices.<br><br>

5.  Be Cautious of Phishing Attacks: Be vigilant about phishing emails and messages that attempt to trick you into revealing personal information or clicking on malicious links.   Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.<br><br>

6. Review App Permissions: When installing new apps, carefully review the permissions they request and only grant access to the necessary features.   Limit access to sensitive data like location, contacts, and camera.
