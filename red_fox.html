Introduction
</h2>
<p>
	<strong>The red fox</strong>(Vulpes vulpes) is the largest of the true foxes and one of the most widely distributed members of the order Carnivora, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere including most of North America, Europe and Asia, plus parts of North Africa. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.Its range has increased alongside human expansion, having been introduced to Australia, where it is considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations. Due to its presence in Australia, it is included on the list of the "world's 100 worst invasive species".

<h2 id="Habitat">
	<p>
	The red fox makes its home along the edges of forests, in tilled fields and near marshes. They prefer habitats with a diversity of vegetation types. Except for breeding females, the fox doesn't usually use a den. Sometimes it will sleep in the open, wrapping its bushy tail around its nose to stay warm.
