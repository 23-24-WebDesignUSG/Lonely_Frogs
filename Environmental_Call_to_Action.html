About Water Pollution
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>The Water Pollution</strong> occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.
    <br>
    <br>

This widespread problem of water pollution is jeopardizing our health. Unsafe water kills more people each year than war and all other forms of violence combined. Meanwhile, our drinkable water sources are finite: Less than 1 percent of the earth’s freshwater is actually accessible to us. Without action, the challenges will only increase by 2050, when global demand for freshwater is expected to be one-third greater than it is now.

    Take Action
    <ul>
        <li>Pick up litter and throw it away in a garbage can.</li>
        <li>
Blow or sweep fertilizer back onto the grass if it gets onto paved areas. Do not put fertilizer on the grass right before it rains. The chemicals will wash into storm drains and waterways.
</li>
<li>
Mulch or compost grass or yard waste, or leave it in your yard if you can't compost. Don't blow leaves into the street. This clogs and damages storm drains.
Wash your car or outdoor equipment where it can flow to a gravel or grassy area instead of a street.
</li>
<li>
Don't pour motor oil down the storm drain. Take it to the nearest auto parts store. It's free!
</li>
<li>
Never clean up a spill by hosing it into a storm drain. Place kitty litter, sand, or another absorbent on the spill. Once the liquid becomes solid - sweep it up and throw it in a garbage can.
</li>
</ul>
